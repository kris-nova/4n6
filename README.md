# xpid 

It's [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) but for pids. ü§ì

`xpid` gives a user the ability to "investigate" for process details on a Linux system.

For example a sleeping thread will have a directory `/proc/[pid]` that can be navigated to, but not listed.

`xpid` will check many different places in the kernel for details about a pid. 
By searching subsets of possible pids `xpid` will be able to check for pid details in many places in the kernel.

```
xpid [flags] -o [output] <query>
   
Investigate pid 123 and write the report to out.txt
  xpid 123 > out.txt

Find all container processes on a system 
  # Looks for /proc/[pid]/ns/cgroup != /proc/1/ns/cgroup 
  xpid -c <query>

Find all processes running with eBPF programs at runtime.
  # Looks for /proc/[pid]/fdinfo and correlates to /sys/fs/bpf
  xpid --ebpf <query>

Find all processes between specific values
  xpid <flags> +100      # Search pids up to 100
  xpid <flags> 100-2000  # Search pids between 100-2000 
  xpid <flags> 65000+    # Search pids 65000 or above

Find all "hidden" processes on a system
  # Looks for chdir, opendir, and dent in /proc
  xpid -x <query>

Find all possible pids on a system, and investigate each one (slow). The --all flag is default.
  xpid > out.txt 

Investigate all pids from 0 to 1000 and write the report to out.json
  xpid -o json 0-1000 > out.json
```

## Container pids (xpid -c) üì¶

`xpid` will lookup container processes at runtime. üéâ

This works by reading the link in [`/proc/[pid]/ns/@cgroup`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html#:~:text=/proc/%5Bpid%5D/ns/cgroup) and correlating it back to the value in `/proc/1/[pid]/ns/@cgroup`.

Regardless of the pid namespace context, if there is a "container" that is unique from the current pid 1, `xpid` will find it.

## eBPF pids (xpid -b) üêù

`xpid` will find pids that have eBPF programs loaded at runtime.

This works by correlating the file descriptor info from [`/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/*`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html#:~:text=file%20descriptor%200.-,/proc/%5Bpid%5D/fdinfo/,-(since%20Linux%202.6.22)) back to `/sys/fs/bpf/progs.debug`. 
If a pid has an eBPF program loaded, `xpid` will find it.

## Hidden pids (xpid -x) üôà

Because of the flexibility with kernel modules and eBPF in the kernel, it can be possible to prevent the [`proc(5)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) filesystem from listing pid details in traditional ways.

`xpid` uses a variety of tactics to search for pids in the same way `nmap` will use different tactics to port scan a target.

## Go runtime

`xpid` is a Go runtime utility that depends on `libxpid`.
Install `libxpid` first (below), and then compile the Go runtime.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kris-nova/xpid.git
cd xpid
make
sudo make install
```

## Xpid C library (libxpid)

`libxpid` is written in C, as it will leverage [`ptrace(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) and eBPF code directly. 
This means that the `xpid` executable is NOT entirely statically linked. 
You must first have `libxpid` installed on your system, before the `xpid` Go program will run.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/kris-nova/xpid.git
cd xpid/libxpid
./configure
cd build
make
sudo make install
```
